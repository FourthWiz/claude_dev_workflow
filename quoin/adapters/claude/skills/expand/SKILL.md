# Expand

Expands a caveman-compressed (terse) workflow artifact back into human-readable English. Dispatches to one of three paths: no-op display for Tier 1 English files, Class B summary detection (reads `## For human` block at top of v3 contract artifacts), or LLM re-expansion for Tier 3 ephemeral files (lossy, banner-flagged). Invoke as `/expand <path>` or `/expand <path> --save`.

This skill implements architecture §5.6's 7-step pipeline. It is the user-facing escape hatch for the caveman-token-optimization v2 architecture — not a contract-approval path.

## §0 Model dispatch (FIRST STEP — execute before anything else)

This skill is declared `model: sonnet`. If the executing agent is running on a model
strictly more expensive than the declared tier, you MUST self-dispatch before doing the
skill's actual work.

Detection:
  - Read your current model from the system context ("powered by the model named X").
  - Tier order: haiku < sonnet < opus.
  - Sentinel parsing: the user's prompt is checked for the `[no-redispatch]` family.
      * Bare `[no-redispatch]` (parent-emit form AND user manual override): skip dispatch, proceed to §1 at the current tier.
      * Counter form `[no-redispatch:N]` where N is a positive integer ≥ 2: ABORT (see "Abort rule" below).
      * Counter form `[no-redispatch:1]` is reserved and treated as bare `[no-redispatch]` for forward-compatibility; do not emit it.
  - If current_tier > declared_tier AND prompt does NOT start with any `[no-redispatch]` form:
      Dispatch reason: cost-guardrail handoff. dispatched-tier: sonnet.
<!-- §0-1m-decide-begin -->
Pre-dispatch 1M check (IVG-90 Layer 1+2):
  - Run: python3 __QUOIN_HOME__/scripts/dispatch_config.py --decide --tier <declared_tier> --verbose
    where <declared_tier> is the tier declared for this skill (e.g. "sonnet" or "haiku",
    as shown in the dispatched-tier line immediately above).
  - If the command returns "safe-path" on line 1:
      Read the reason token from line 2 (config|cache|probe).
      Emit the one-line advisory (verbatim, substituting <reason> with the line-2 token):
        `[quoin: 1M-unsafe declared-tier per <reason>; running SAFE PATH without dispatch]`
      Then proceed to §1/§0c at the current tier (treat as if [no-redispatch] were present).
      Do NOT call the Agent dispatch. Do NOT call AskUserQuestion.
  - If the command returns "dispatch" on line 1, OR if the script is missing / errors:
      Continue to the Agent dispatch call below (today's path — fail-OPEN).
<!-- §0-1m-decide-end -->
      Spawn an Agent subagent with the following arguments:
        model: "sonnet"
        description: "expand dispatched at sonnet tier"
        prompt: "[no-redispatch]\n<original user input verbatim>"
      Wait for the subagent.
<!-- §0-1m-cachewrite-begin -->
      Cache the safe result (best-effort):
        python3 __QUOIN_HOME__/scripts/dispatch_config.py --write-cache --tier <declared_tier> --result safe
      (Fail-OPEN: if the script errors or is missing, silently skip and continue.)
<!-- §0-1m-cachewrite-end -->
      Return its output as your final response. STOP.
      (Return the subagent's output as your final response.)

Abort rule (recursion guard):
  - If the prompt starts with `[no-redispatch:N]` AND N ≥ 2: ABORT before any tool calls.
  - Print the one-line error: `Quoin self-dispatch hard-cap reached at N=<N> in expand. This indicates a recursion bug; aborting before any tool calls. Re-invoke with [no-redispatch] (bare) to override.`
  - Then stop. Do NOT proceed to §1.

Manual kill switch:
  - The user can prefix any user-typed slash invocation with bare `[no-redispatch]` to skip dispatch entirely (e.g., `[no-redispatch] /expand`).
  - Why this is safe to share syntax with the parent-emit form: memory/dispatch-guide.md §0 verbose reference ("Why the bare [no-redispatch] sentinel is dual-source by design").
  - Use this only when intentionally overriding the cost guardrail (e.g., for one-off debugging on a different tier).

<!-- §0-worktree-fallback-begin -->
Fail-graceful path with error-class triage (per architecture I-01):
  - If the Agent tool returns an error during dispatch, classify the error
    message text BEFORE proceeding:

  - Error classification:
      * Worktree-class: the error text contains the substring
        `Cannot create agent worktree`, OR (the substring `worktree` AND
        the substring `not in a git repository`). This is recoverable —
        the harness tried to create a git worktree for isolation and the
        project root is not a git repo. Continue to Worktree-class branch.
      * Other-class: any other tool error, exception, or harness rejection
        — skip to Other-class path below (existing fail-OPEN behavior).

  - 1M-credit-class: if the error text contains the substring
      `Usage credits required for 1M context`:
      This is the 1M-context credit mismatch (IVG-89). The parent session carries
      the `context-1m-2025-08-07` beta header which propagates to all subagent calls;
      the declared-tier model lacks 1M credits. Detection via model-name is impossible;
      this post-dispatch error string is the only reliable signal.
      Emit (verbatim):
        `[quoin: 1M-context credit mismatch on <tier> subagent dispatch; proceeding in-session at parent tier — run /model to switch this session to standard context for a permanent fix]`
<!-- §0-1m-cachewrite-begin -->
      Cache the unsafe result (best-effort):
        python3 __QUOIN_HOME__/scripts/dispatch_config.py --write-cache --tier <declared_tier> --result unsafe
      (Fail-OPEN: if the script errors or is missing, silently skip and continue.)
<!-- §0-1m-cachewrite-end -->
      Then proceed to §1 at the current tier (treat as if `[no-redispatch]` were present).
      Do NOT retry the Agent dispatch. Do NOT call AskUserQuestion.


  - Worktree-class branch:
      Autonomous fail-OPEN (checked FIRST): if the incoming prompt carries
      the `[autonomous]` sentinel, then on this worktree-class dispatch
      error, proceed at current tier fail-OPEN and do NOT call
      AskUserQuestion — skip straight to the Other-class path below (it
      emits the bare warning and the `error-class=worktree` classification
      line), then proceed to §1 at the current tier. Otherwise (no
      `[autonomous]` sentinel — non-autonomous behavior unchanged):
      Worktree creation is hook-driven and cannot be skipped by omitting a
      parameter. Use the AskUserQuestion tool to present the user with one
      option:
        (c) `proceed-current-tier` — Skip dispatch, proceed at the current
            (more expensive) tier. This is the only available recovery path.
      Question header: `Subagent dispatch failed (worktree creation). Proceeding at current tier.`
      Note for the user: "Worktree dispatch failed and no retry mechanism
      is available — worktree creation is unconditional in this harness.
      Proceeding at current tier."

  - Other-class path (also: worktree-class after user acknowledges c):
      Do NOT abort the user's invocation.
      Emit the bare warning (verbatim):
        `[quoin-stage-1: subagent dispatch unavailable; proceeding at current tier]`
      If this path was reached via a worktree-class error, ALSO emit the
      classification line (second, separate):
        `[quoin-stage-1: error-class=worktree; user-choice=c; proceeding at current tier]`
      Then proceed to §1 at the current tier (fail-OPEN per I-01).
<!-- §0-worktree-fallback-end -->
Otherwise (already at or below declared tier, OR prompt has [no-redispatch] sentinel, OR dispatch unavailable): proceed to §1 (skill body).
<!-- §0-end -->

## §0‴ Minimum-tier guard (execute after §0 — before any §0-sidecar block and the skill body)
This skill is declared model: "sonnet". If the executing agent is running on a model
strictly CHEAPER than sonnet, it silently up-dispatches to a Sonnet subagent (mirrors §0 down-dispatch).

<!-- §0tripleprime-begin -->
Detection:
  - Read your current model from system context ("powered by the model named X").
  - Tier order: haiku < sonnet < opus. declared_tier = sonnet.
  - Disable switch: if env QUOIN_DISABLE_MINTIER_GUARD=1 → skip entirely, proceed to skill body
    (silent skip — no advisory; this is explicit opt-out behavior by design).
  - Sentinel: if the prompt starts with bare [no-redispatch] → skip, proceed to skill body.
  - Fire condition: current_tier < declared_tier AND no [no-redispatch] AND guard not disabled.
  - Recursion: counter form `[no-redispatch:N]` (N≥2) never reaches this block — §0 (earlier in this file) aborts on N≥2 before any §0‴ tool call.

On fire (happy path — silent up-dispatch):
  spawn an Agent subagent:
    model: "sonnet"
    description: "expand — min-tier up-dispatch"
    prompt: "[no-redispatch]\n<original user input verbatim>"
  Wait for the subagent. Return its output as your final response. STOP.

Fail-OPEN path (fires only when Agent dispatch fails). Full AskUserQuestion Question/Header/
description wording for every branch below: memory/dispatch-guide.md §0‴ verbose reference
("Verbatim AskUserQuestion wording"). Classify the error text BEFORE proceeding:

  - Autonomous-class (checked FIRST, before 1M-credit or generic classification): if the
    incoming prompt carries the `[autonomous]` sentinel, then on ANY §0‴ dispatch-failure or
    1M-context-credit error, proceed at current tier fail-OPEN and DO NOT call `AskUserQuestion`
    — skip the 1M-credit-class and generic branches below entirely. Print
    `[quoin-mintier-autonomous: §0‴ dispatch failed; proceeding fail-OPEN at current tier]` and
    proceed to skill body (treat as bare [no-redispatch]).

  - 1M-credit-class: if error text contains `Usage credits required for 1M context`:
      Issue AskUserQuestion (full Question/Header wording: memory/dispatch-guide.md
      §0‴ verbose reference):
        Option 1:
          label: "Abort — I'll switch with /model first"
        Option 2:
          label: "Proceed in-session at parent tier"
      On Option 1: print `[quoin-mintier: 1M-context credit mismatch; abort per user choice —
      switch with /model and re-invoke /expand]` and STOP.
      On Option 2: print `[quoin-mintier: 1M-context credit mismatch on sonnet up-dispatch;
      proceeding in-session at parent tier — run /model to switch to standard context]`
      and proceed to skill body (treat as bare [no-redispatch]).

  - Any other error: Issue AskUserQuestion (labels verbatim — drift relies on equality):
        Option 1:
          label: "Abort — run from a Sonnet session"
        Option 2:
          label: "Proceed at current tier (under-powered)"
      On Option 1: print `[quoin-mintier: aborted; re-invoke /expand from a Sonnet session]` and STOP.
      On Option 2: print `[quoin-mintier: min-tier up-dispatch unavailable; proceeding at current tier per user choice]`, then proceed to skill body (treat as bare [no-redispatch]).

## Session bootstrap

If your incoming prompt contains `[quoin-onbehalf]`: SKIP this cost-ledger self-write — the spawning orchestrator records this row on your behalf (D-1). Strip `[quoin-onbehalf]` at bootstrap step 0 (per-spawn, non-inherited — do not propagate to children).

Cost ledger: if a task context is determinable from the path or active session, append a row with phase `expand` to `.workflow_artifacts/<task-name>/cost-ledger.md`. Row format per CLAUDE.md cost-tracking rules. If no task context is active, skip cost recording.

<!-- quoin:ledger-self-write -->

`/expand` does NOT write session state (architecture §5.4 explicit).

## Hardcoded Tier 1 path list

Files matching any entry below are always English — display as-is with the Tier 1 banner. Never send them through LLM re-expansion.

```
# Exact paths:
quoin/CLAUDE.md
quoin/memory/terse-rubric.md
.claude/memory/terse-rubric.md
.workflow_artifacts/memory/MEMORY.md
.workflow_artifacts/memory/lessons-learned.md

# Per-task paths (resolve <task> to the active task name at runtime):
.workflow_artifacts/<task>/architecture.md
.workflow_artifacts/<task>/review-*.md
.workflow_artifacts/<task>/cost-ledger.md

# Glob patterns:
.workflow_artifacts/memory/weekly/*.md
.workflow_artifacts/memory/daily/<date>.md   # daily briefings — NOT insights-<date>.md
```

**Note:** Adding a Tier 1 path requires updating this file — this is an exception pattern per lesson 2026-04-13 (`run-skill`) and is documented inline here so it is discoverable when other Tier 1 additions are made.

## 7-step pipeline

Execute steps in order. Stop at the first step that produces output.

### Step 1: Resolve path

Attempt to resolve `<path>` to an absolute file. Try in order: (a) as an absolute path, (b) relative to the project root (the directory containing `.workflow_artifacts/`), (c) relative to `.workflow_artifacts/`.

If the file does not exist after all resolution attempts → print `/expand: path not found: <path>` and exit. No LLM call.

### Step 2: Empty-file check

Read the file. If it is 0 bytes → print `/expand: <path> is empty, nothing to expand` and exit. No LLM call.

### Step 3: Binary-content check

Attempt to decode the first 1024 bytes as UTF-8. If decoding fails (non-UTF-8 content) → print `/expand: <path> is not UTF-8 text; /expand operates on markdown only` and exit. No LLM call.

### Step 4: Class B summary detection

# v3-format detection (architecture.md §5.7.1 — copy verbatim)
# A file is v3-format iff:
#   - the first 50 lines following the closing `---` of the YAML frontmatter
#     contain a heading matching the regex ^## For human\s*$
# Otherwise the file is v2-format.
# On v3-format detection: read sections per format-kit.md for this artifact type.
# On v2-format (or no frontmatter): read the whole file as legacy v2.
# Detection MUST be string-comparison only — no LLM call (per lesson 2026-04-23
# on LLM-replay non-determinism).

If `<path>` matches a Class B path (`current-plan.md`, `architecture.md`, `review-*.md`, `daily/<date>.md`, `weekly/*.md`) AND the file contains a `## For human` heading within the first 50 lines per the rule above → display the message:

  `<path>` is a Class B artifact with a built-in `## For human` summary at the top.
  Showing summary; pass `--full` to see the structured body.

Then display the `## For human` block content.

`/expand <path> --full` displays the full body.
`/expand <path> --section <name>` displays a single named section (works on Class A and Class B).

Done — no LLM call.

### Step 5: Tier 1 path match

Check whether the resolved path matches any entry in the Tier 1 path list above. Matching rules:

- **Exact paths:** compare the resolved absolute path's suffix against each exact entry (e.g., `quoin/CLAUDE.md` matches any resolved path ending in `quoin/CLAUDE.md`).
- **Per-task patterns:** resolve `<task>` to the active task name if determinable from context or current session state; otherwise match with the literal pattern `<task>` as a wildcard segment. `review-*.md` is a glob-style wildcard within the segment.
- **Glob patterns:** match using standard shell-glob semantics (`*` matches within a directory segment; `<date>` matches any `YYYY-MM-DD`-shaped segment).

If the path matches any entry → display the file content as-is. Print banner:

```
Already English (Tier 1 file: <matching-pattern>)
```

Done — no LLM call.

### Step 6: Size warning

If the file is larger than 500 KB → print:

```
/expand: <path> is <size> KB; LLM re-expansion will cost approximately $<estimate>. Proceed? (y/n)
```

Cost estimate formula: `(size_bytes / 4) * 1.5 * 15 / 1_000_000` dollars (bytes→tokens via /4, expansion factor 1.5, Sonnet output price $15/M tokens).

Wait for user input. On `n` → exit with no action.

### Step 7: LLM re-expansion

Invoke Sonnet with the re-expansion prompt below. Display the result with the warning banner:

```
⚠️ LLM re-expansion (lossy — may diverge from terse source). Do NOT use for contract-file approval.
```

## Re-expansion prompt

> You are expanding a caveman-style terse artifact back into full English prose for human reading. Preserve **verbatim**: all file paths, identifiers, code blocks, URLs, commands, version numbers, headings, section markers (CRITICAL, MAJOR, MINOR, PASS, REVISE), issue identifiers (CRIT-N, MAJ-N, MIN-N), negations, quantifiers, numeric counts. Do **not** introduce facts, examples, or reasoning not present in the source. If the source is ambiguous, flag "[ambiguous]" rather than inventing a reading. Write in plain English prose or bulleted lists, whichever matches the source's organization. Source content follows:
>
> ---
> {terse content}
> ---
>
> Expanded English version:

## Optional `--save` flag

`/expand <path> --save` writes the expansion to `<path>.expanded-<ISO-timestamp>.md` (e.g., `critic-response-1.expanded-2026-04-23T14:30:00.md`). Never overwrites the source file. The `--save` flag is deliberately opt-in to avoid accumulating expansion artifacts across sessions. Files matching `*.expanded-*.md` are gitignored (added in Task 9 of the caveman-token-optimization Stage 1 plan).

## Warning banner

Every LLM re-expansion output starts with:

> ⚠️ **LLM re-expansion.** This is a best-effort reconstruction from the terse source. The reconstructed text is not byte-identical to what other skills read. Do NOT use this expansion to approve a contract artifact like `current-plan.md` — for Class B contract artifacts, `/gate` reads the `## For human` summary block at the top of the artifact directly (per architecture v3 §5.5).

(Emoji is explicitly permitted in this banner — it is a UX signal, not content decoration, per architecture §5.4.)

## Important behaviors

- **Never use re-expansion for contract approval.** Class B contract artifacts (`current-plan.md`, `architecture.md`, `review-*.md`) carry their user-facing summary in a `## For human` block at the top of the file, read directly by `/gate`. If a user tries to approve a contract artifact via `/expand`, direct them to `/gate` instead — `/gate` reads the structural file, not a lossy LLM reconstruction.
- **`--save` is opt-in.** Without `--save`, no file is written to disk. The expansion is displayed to the user only. Do not auto-save.
- **Path ambiguity resolution:** prefer project-root-relative resolution over `.workflow_artifacts/`-relative. If both resolve to existing files, use the project-root-relative match and note the ambiguity to the user.
