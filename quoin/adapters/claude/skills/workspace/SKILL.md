## §0 Model dispatch (FIRST STEP — execute before anything else)

This skill is declared `model: sonnet`. If the executing agent is running on a model
strictly more expensive than the declared tier, you MUST self-dispatch before doing the
skill's actual work.

Detection:
  - Read your current model from the system context ("powered by the model named X").
  - Tier order: haiku < sonnet < opus.
  - Sentinel parsing: the user's prompt is checked for the `[no-redispatch]` family.
      * Bare `[no-redispatch]` (parent-emit form AND user manual override): skip dispatch, proceed to §1 at the current tier.
      * Counter form `[no-redispatch:N]` where N is a positive integer ≥ 2: ABORT (see "Abort rule" below).
      * Counter form `[no-redispatch:1]` is reserved and treated as bare `[no-redispatch]` for forward-compatibility; do not emit it.
  - If current_tier > declared_tier AND prompt does NOT start with any `[no-redispatch]` form:
      Dispatch reason: cost-guardrail handoff. dispatched-tier: sonnet.
<!-- §0-1m-decide-begin -->
Pre-dispatch 1M check (IVG-90 Layer 1+2):
  - Run: python3 __QUOIN_HOME__/scripts/dispatch_config.py --decide --tier <declared_tier> --verbose
    where <declared_tier> is the tier declared for this skill (e.g. "sonnet" or "haiku",
    as shown in the dispatched-tier line immediately above).
  - If the command returns "safe-path" on line 1:
      Read the reason token from line 2 (config|cache|probe).
      Emit the one-line advisory (verbatim, substituting <reason> with the line-2 token):
        `[quoin: 1M-unsafe declared-tier per <reason>; running SAFE PATH without dispatch]`
      Then proceed to §1/§0c at the current tier (treat as if [no-redispatch] were present).
      Do NOT call the Agent dispatch. Do NOT call AskUserQuestion.
  - If the command returns "dispatch" on line 1, OR if the script is missing / errors:
      Continue to the Agent dispatch call below (today's path — fail-OPEN).
<!-- §0-1m-decide-end -->
      Spawn an Agent subagent with the following arguments:
        model: "sonnet"
        description: "workspace dispatched at sonnet tier"
        prompt: "[no-redispatch]\n<original user input verbatim>"
      Wait for the subagent.
<!-- §0-1m-cachewrite-begin -->
      Cache the safe result (best-effort):
        python3 __QUOIN_HOME__/scripts/dispatch_config.py --write-cache --tier <declared_tier> --result safe
      (Fail-OPEN: if the script errors or is missing, silently skip and continue.)
<!-- §0-1m-cachewrite-end -->
      Return its output as your final response. STOP.
      (Return the subagent's output as your final response.)

Abort rule (recursion guard):
  - If the prompt starts with `[no-redispatch:N]` AND N ≥ 2: ABORT before any tool calls.
  - Print the one-line error: `Quoin self-dispatch hard-cap reached at N=<N> in workspace. This indicates a recursion bug; aborting before any tool calls. Re-invoke with [no-redispatch] (bare) to override.`
  - Then stop. Do NOT proceed to §1.

Manual kill switch:
  - The user can prefix any user-typed slash invocation with bare `[no-redispatch]` to skip dispatch entirely (e.g., `[no-redispatch] /workspace`).
  - Why this is safe to share syntax with the parent-emit form: memory/dispatch-guide.md §0 verbose reference ("Why the bare [no-redispatch] sentinel is dual-source by design").
  - Use this only when intentionally overriding the cost guardrail (e.g., for one-off debugging on a different tier).

<!-- §0-worktree-fallback-begin -->
Fail-graceful path with error-class triage (per architecture I-01):
  - If the Agent tool returns an error during dispatch, classify the error
    message text BEFORE proceeding:

  - Error classification:
      * Worktree-class: the error text contains the substring
        `Cannot create agent worktree`, OR (the substring `worktree` AND
        the substring `not in a git repository`). This is recoverable —
        the harness tried to create a git worktree for isolation and the
        project root is not a git repo. Continue to Worktree-class branch.
      * Other-class: any other tool error, exception, or harness rejection
        — skip to Other-class path below (existing fail-OPEN behavior).

  - 1M-credit-class: if the error text contains the substring
      `Usage credits required for 1M context`:
      This is the 1M-context credit mismatch (IVG-89). The parent session carries
      the `context-1m-2025-08-07` beta header which propagates to all subagent calls;
      the declared-tier model lacks 1M credits. Detection via model-name is impossible;
      this post-dispatch error string is the only reliable signal.
      Emit (verbatim):
        `[quoin: 1M-context credit mismatch on <tier> subagent dispatch; proceeding in-session at parent tier — run /model to switch this session to standard context for a permanent fix]`
<!-- §0-1m-cachewrite-begin -->
      Cache the unsafe result (best-effort):
        python3 __QUOIN_HOME__/scripts/dispatch_config.py --write-cache --tier <declared_tier> --result unsafe
      (Fail-OPEN: if the script errors or is missing, silently skip and continue.)
<!-- §0-1m-cachewrite-end -->
      Then proceed to §1 at the current tier (treat as if `[no-redispatch]` were present).
      Do NOT retry the Agent dispatch. Do NOT call AskUserQuestion.


<!-- §0-sidecar-begin -->
  Source-mutating dispatch — two-phase worktree isolation (D-08):

  STEP A0 — Consult the worktree-isolation decider FIRST (default is skip):
     Run via Bash:
       python3 __QUOIN_HOME__/scripts/worktree_isolation.py --decide
     Isolation is opt-in (D-04): the decider prints `skip` unless
     QUOIN_WORKTREE_ISOLATION=on, the dispatch.json config opts in, or a prior probe
     wrote a `works` sentinel. If the output is `skip`, DO NOT write the sidecar and
     DO NOT dispatch with isolation: "worktree" — skip STEP A / STEP B / STEP C and go
     straight to a PLAIN Agent dispatch at the declared cheap-tier model (sonnet), with
     no sidecar write and no worktree round-trip. Only when the output is `attempt` do
     STEP A / STEP B / STEP C run.

  STEP A — Write the dispatch sidecar BEFORE calling the Agent tool:
     Run via Bash:
       PROJECT_ROOT="$(python3 __QUOIN_HOME__/scripts/path_resolve.py --print-project-root)"
       python3 __QUOIN_HOME__/scripts/dispatch_sidecar.py \
           --skill <skill-name> \
           --project-root "$PROJECT_ROOT" \
           --plan "<resolved-plan-path-or-empty>"
     (The WorktreeCreate hook reads this sidecar to resolve the nested git root.)

  STEP B — Phase 1: Agent dispatch WITH isolation: "worktree" (normal path):
     Call the Agent tool with isolation: "worktree" at the declared cheap-tier
     model (sonnet for this skill). The deployed WorktreeCreate hook at
     __QUOIN_HOME__/hooks/worktreecreate.sh reads the sidecar, runs
     git_root_for_dispatch.py, and (when a single nested repo resolves)
     creates a worktree IN the nested git root and returns its path.
     One-time probe (opt-in path only): when the probe sentinel is still unknown,
     instruct the child to record its working directory to a marker; after the Agent
     returns, compare it to the created worktree path and persist the result exactly
     once via
       python3 __QUOIN_HOME__/scripts/worktree_isolation.py --write-probe --result works|broken

  STEP C — Phase 2 retry WITHOUT isolation (on Worktree-class error):
     If Phase 1 fails with a Worktree-class error (regex above), the hook
     either returned skip (no stdout → harness fails) or encountered an error.
     Re-dispatch the Agent call WITHOUT isolation: "worktree", at the SAME
     declared cheap-tier model (sonnet). Do NOT escalate to parent tier.
     Emit one-line audit:
       [quoin-stage-1: worktree dispatch skipped; proceeding at sonnet without isolation]
     Autonomous fail-OPEN: if the incoming prompt carries the `[autonomous]`
     sentinel, then on any worktree-class dispatch error, proceed at current
     tier fail-OPEN and do NOT call AskUserQuestion — this is already
     guaranteed unconditionally by this Phase 2 retry (no AskUserQuestion
     exists in this path to skip), so behavior here is identical with or
     without the sentinel.

  STEP D — Done:
     No child-side coordination required. The harness handles cwd correctly:
     on Phase 1 success, child sees the worktree as cwd; on Phase 2, child
     inherits the parent's session cwd (today's behavior, unchanged).
<!-- §0-sidecar-end -->

  - Worktree-class branch: handled by Phase 2 (§0-sidecar block above).
    Phase 2 retries at the declared cheap-tier model without isolation.
    Do NOT use AskUserQuestion or proceed-current-tier for source-mutating skills.

  - Other-class path (non-worktree Agent errors):
      Do NOT abort the user's invocation.
      Emit the bare warning (verbatim):
        `[quoin-stage-1: subagent dispatch unavailable; proceeding at current tier]`
      If this path was reached via a worktree-class error, ALSO emit the
      classification line (second, separate):
        `[quoin-stage-1: error-class=worktree; user-choice=c; proceeding at current tier]`
      Then proceed to §1 at the current tier (fail-OPEN per I-01).
<!-- §0-worktree-fallback-end -->
Otherwise (already at or below declared tier, OR prompt has [no-redispatch] sentinel, OR dispatch unavailable): proceed to §1 (skill body).

<!-- §0b: intentionally omitted — /workspace has no sub-phase dispatch -->
<!-- §0-end -->

## §0‴ Minimum-tier guard (execute after §0 — before any §0-sidecar block and the skill body)
This skill is declared model: "sonnet". If the executing agent is running on a model
strictly CHEAPER than sonnet, it silently up-dispatches to a Sonnet subagent (mirrors §0 down-dispatch).

<!-- §0tripleprime-begin -->
Detection:
  - Read your current model from system context ("powered by the model named X").
  - Tier order: haiku < sonnet < opus. declared_tier = sonnet.
  - Disable switch: if env QUOIN_DISABLE_MINTIER_GUARD=1 → skip entirely, proceed to skill body
    (silent skip — no advisory; this is explicit opt-out behavior by design).
  - Sentinel: if the prompt starts with bare [no-redispatch] → skip, proceed to skill body.
  - Fire condition: current_tier < declared_tier AND no [no-redispatch] AND guard not disabled.
  - Recursion: counter form `[no-redispatch:N]` (N≥2) never reaches this block — §0 (earlier in this file) aborts on N≥2 before any §0‴ tool call.

On fire (happy path — silent up-dispatch):
  spawn an Agent subagent:
    model: "sonnet"
    description: "workspace — min-tier up-dispatch"
    prompt: "[no-redispatch]\n<original user input verbatim>"
  Wait for the subagent. Return its output as your final response. STOP.

Fail-OPEN path (fires only when Agent dispatch fails). Full AskUserQuestion Question/Header/
description wording for every branch below: memory/dispatch-guide.md §0‴ verbose reference
("Verbatim AskUserQuestion wording"). Classify the error text BEFORE proceeding:

  - Autonomous-class (checked FIRST, before 1M-credit or generic classification): if the
    incoming prompt carries the `[autonomous]` sentinel, then on ANY §0‴ dispatch-failure or
    1M-context-credit error, proceed at current tier fail-OPEN and DO NOT call `AskUserQuestion`
    — skip the 1M-credit-class and generic branches below entirely. Print
    `[quoin-mintier-autonomous: §0‴ dispatch failed; proceeding fail-OPEN at current tier]` and
    proceed to skill body (treat as bare [no-redispatch]).

  - 1M-credit-class: if error text contains `Usage credits required for 1M context`:
      Issue AskUserQuestion (full Question/Header wording: memory/dispatch-guide.md
      §0‴ verbose reference):
        Option 1:
          label: "Abort — I'll switch with /model first"
        Option 2:
          label: "Proceed in-session at parent tier"
      On Option 1: print `[quoin-mintier: 1M-context credit mismatch; abort per user choice —
      switch with /model and re-invoke /workspace]` and STOP.
      On Option 2: print `[quoin-mintier: 1M-context credit mismatch on sonnet up-dispatch;
      proceeding in-session at parent tier — run /model to switch to standard context]`
      and proceed to skill body (treat as bare [no-redispatch]).

  - Any other error: Issue AskUserQuestion (labels verbatim — drift relies on equality):
        Option 1:
          label: "Abort — run from a Sonnet session"
        Option 2:
          label: "Proceed at current tier (under-powered)"
      On Option 1: print `[quoin-mintier: aborted; re-invoke /workspace from a Sonnet session]` and STOP.
      On Option 2: print `[quoin-mintier: min-tier up-dispatch unavailable; proceeding at current tier per user choice]`, then proceed to skill body (treat as bare [no-redispatch]).

## When to use

Whenever a user or orchestrator wants an isolated per-repo `git worktree` for
concurrent session work — most commonly to let `/run` (or a manually-started
task) work on one feature while another session owns the main tree. The user
explicitly invokes `/workspace create|status|takeover|teardown`.

This skill is **never auto-invoked** by any orchestrator or skill.

## Session bootstrap

On start:
If your incoming prompt contains `[quoin-onbehalf]`: SKIP this cost-ledger self-write — the spawning orchestrator records this row on your behalf (D-1). Strip `[quoin-onbehalf]` at bootstrap step 0 (per-spawn, non-inherited — do not propagate to children).

1. Append your session to the cost ledger: `.workflow_artifacts/<task-name>/cost-ledger.md` — phase: `workspace`

<!-- quoin:ledger-self-write -->
2. Write session state to `.workflow_artifacts/memory/sessions/<date>-<task-name>.md`

## Process

The mechanism lives entirely in `quoin/core/scripts/workspace.py`. This
adapter is a thin dispatcher over that script's four subcommands, plus the
two confirmation gates below (the skill's only non-thin logic).

### Step 1: `create`

1. Run: `python3 __QUOIN_HOME__/scripts/workspace.py create <feature> [--repos <csv>] [--base <ref>]`.
2. Render the per-repo `CreateResult`: which repos got a fresh worktree, which
   were refreshed, the feature branch name, and the ownership-record path.
3. Confirm the original tree was left untouched (the script guarantees this;
   just surface it).

### Step 2: `status` (a.k.a. list)

1. Run: `python3 __QUOIN_HOME__/scripts/workspace.py status`.
2. Render every known workspace: owner, liveness, branch, and — best effort —
   merge state (surfaced when the host CLI, e.g. `gh`, is available; degrades
   silently when it is not).
3. **CONFIRMATION GATE (b) — post-merge teardown OFFER:** for any workspace
   whose branch `status` reports as merged, OFFER teardown via
   `AskUserQuestion` ("this workspace's branch has merged — tear it down
   now?"). NEVER run teardown automatically from this offer. Under
   `[no-interactive]` or `[autonomous]` invocation, fail CLOSED: record the
   offer in the output text but do NOT action it — no `--force`, no delete,
   without an interactive human choice.

### Step 3: `takeover`

1. Run: `python3 __QUOIN_HOME__/scripts/workspace.py takeover <feature> [--force]`.
2. If the script refuses because the current owner is LIVE and non-self,
   report that refusal — do not silently retry with `--force`; that decision
   belongs to the user (a manual re-invocation with `--force` if they confirm
   the takeover is safe).
3. Render the `TakeoverResult`: confirm the ownership record's owner fields
   were reassigned, and that no worktree or branch changed.

### Step 4: `teardown`

1. Run (without `--force` first): `python3 __QUOIN_HOME__/scripts/workspace.py teardown <feature>`.
2. **CONFIRMATION GATE (a) — teardown-with-dirty-work:** if the script
   reports any unsafe worktree (uncommitted changes, unpushed commits, and
   not proven-merged), issue an `AskUserQuestion` — "this workspace has
   [unsafe reason]; proceed with `--force` or abort?" — before re-invoking
   with `--force`. NEVER pass `--force` without that confirmation. Under
   `[no-interactive]` or `[autonomous]` invocation, fail CLOSED: report the
   refusal and STOP — do NOT force-remove without an interactive human choice.
3. On a clean pass (or a user-confirmed forced pass), confirm the worktree,
   ownership record, and workspace folder were removed.

## Cost tracking

Append to the task's cost ledger at `.workflow_artifacts/<task-name>/cost-ledger.md`
with phase `workspace` (see cost tracking rules in CLAUDE.md).

## Session state

Write to `.workflow_artifacts/memory/sessions/<date>-<task-name>.md` after
each subcommand invocation completes.
