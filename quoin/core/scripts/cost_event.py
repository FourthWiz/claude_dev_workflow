"""Portable cost-event schema and ledger-row parser.

This module is runtime-neutral and does NOT participate in price computation,
session-UUID acquisition, or adapter-specific session-log parsing. It provides
a typed schema for cost-ledger rows and pure functions to parse and format them.

Warning prefix kept as 'cost_snapshot.WARN' for parity with existing consumers
(test_cost_ledger_7col_parser.py and cost_snapshot/SKILL.md); a future
SKILL.md-narrowing phase will decide whether to rename to 'cost_event.WARN'.

This module is runtime-neutral; it MUST NOT import from any Claude-adapter-owned
helper (the session-log-reading or session-age scripts under quoin/scripts/). The
portable cost-event schema lives here; runtime-specific cost collection lives in
the Claude adapter.

Schema alignment: the field names and parsing rules described here match the
expanded contract in quoin/core/workflow/cost-ledger.md. Both are kept
content-aligned; that document is the prose reference, this module is the
canonical typed implementation.

    rows: iterable of objects/dicts exposing uuid/phase/model_or_effort/note/
        attribution (accepts CostEvent instances or the row-dict shape used
        by adapter readers — a small internal accessor normalizes access;
        CostEvent is not hard-required).
    resolve_session_cost: callable(uuid) -> tuple[float, bool] returning
        (whole_session_cost, has_cost). Injected by the caller — each adapter
        supplies its own session-cost source. Called AT MOST ONCE per
        distinct legacy UUID (memoized internally). This injection is what
        keeps this module free of any adapter-owned import: session-cost
        resolution stays entirely the caller's responsibility.

    Algorithm: rows are split into three streams — resolved-inline (their
    own already-priced usd, summed directly), unresolvable (contribute
    nothing, counted honestly), and legacy (no col-8 attribution at all,
    candidates for cohort grouping). Legacy rows are grouped by uuid: a uuid
    used by exactly one row (solo) has its session cost resolved and
    attributed to that row's phase exactly as before (byte-identical to the
    pre-cohort behavior); a uuid shared by two or more legacy rows (a
    "cohort") does NOT charge any participating phase the session cost —
    instead the session cost is resolved once and added to a single labeled
    shared bucket, and each participating phase is recorded (with a
    checkpoint-specific save/restore split) as a shared, not separately
    attributable participant. Every distinct session's cost is counted
    exactly once in resolved_total, regardless of how many rows or phases
    reference its UUID.

    Cohort membership and the `--since` interaction: this function groups
    the rows it is GIVEN — any date-window filtering must happen in the
    caller BEFORE calling this function, so cohorts form over the filtered
    row set. If a `--since` filter splits a shared session across the
    filter boundary, only the in-window rows form the cohort; the session
    cost is still resolved once from the injected session-cost source
    (which reports a lifetime total) — so a windowed cohort may attribute a
    session cost whose rows are partly out of window. This matches today's
    lifetime session-cost semantics and is not a regression; the labeled
    shared bucket makes the situation visible rather than misleading.

    Fail-open: any internal error while computing the cohort returns None,
    signaling the caller to fall back to its own per-row legacy
    accumulation. A `resolve_session_cost` that itself raises for a given
    uuid is treated as (0.0, False) for that uuid only — it does not fail
    the whole call.

    Returns a CohortResult (frozen dataclass), or None on internal failure.
