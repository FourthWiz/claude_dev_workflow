# Skill Metadata

`skills.json` is the runtime-neutral skill catalog for Quoin.

It does not drive runtime behavior yet. Existing Claude skill frontmatter remains the active runtime source until a generator or adapter loader is introduced.

## Ownership

The portable core owns these fields:

- `schema_version` — version of the manifest shape.
- `skills` — list of skill metadata entries.
- `name` — stable skill identifier, matching the directory under `quoin/skills/`.
- `phase` — runtime-neutral workflow phase or responsibility.
- `effort` — runtime-neutral effort level from `quoin/docs/effort-levels.md`.
- `user_facing` — whether users should invoke or route to the skill directly.
- `claude_model` — compatibility metadata copied from current Claude `model:` frontmatter.

`effort` is the portable field. Runtime adapters should map effort to their own model or reasoning controls.

`claude_model` exists to keep the manifest auditable against current Claude behavior. It should not be used by non-Claude adapters.

## Current Constraints

- Every `quoin/skills/*/SKILL.md` file must have exactly one manifest entry.
- `claude_model` must match current skill frontmatter.
- `effort` must be one of `low`, `medium`, `high`, or `max`.
- `revise-fast` remains internal with `user_facing: false`.
- No Codex model names belong in this manifest.

## Future Use

Future adapter work may use this manifest to generate runtime-specific command tables, install manifests, or adapter overlays. Do not generate active Claude files from it until compatibility tests cover the generated output.

## Schema version 2 fields

Phase 22 added two optional boolean fields per skill entry. Both default to `false` when absent (backward-compatible with existing schema-v1 readers).

- `section_0` — whether the Claude adapter `SKILL.md` must carry the `## §0 Model dispatch (FIRST STEP — execute before anything else)` block. Derived from the 12 cheap-tier enumeration in `quoin/CLAUDE.md` (§0 Model dispatch preamble section). Skills with `section_0: true` self-dispatch to their declared model tier when invoked from a more expensive session. When adding a new skill, set `section_0: true` if the skill is cheap-tier (Haiku or Sonnet) and must carry the §0 dispatch block.

- `spawn_target` — whether the skill is a subagent-preamble spawn target (one of the 7 skills in `build_preambles.py::SPAWN_TARGETS`). Spawn-target skills must have a `preamble.md` alongside the legacy stub at `quoin/skills/<name>/preamble.md` (the path install.sh copies from). When adding a new skill that is a spawn target, generate and commit the preamble via `build_preambles.py`, then set `spawn_target: true`.

Both fields are enforced by the adapter drift validator (see below). New skills must declare both fields explicitly in `skills.json` — omitting them defaults both to `false`, which would cause a validator violation if the skill is actually cheap-tier or a spawn target.

## Adapter drift validator

The adapter drift validator (`validate_adapter_drift.py`) checks 16 structural invariants across the three-file adapter pattern for every skill in the manifest.

**Location:**
- Canonical implementation: `quoin/core/scripts/validate_adapter_drift.py` (Claude-adapter-specific in scope)
- Compatibility wrapper: `quoin/scripts/validate_adapter_drift.py`

**How to run locally:**
```
python3 quoin/core/scripts/validate_adapter_drift.py
```
Exit 0 = PASS, exit 2 = DRIFT detected. Use `--json` for structured output.

**How CI runs it:** `pytest quoin/dev/tests/test_validate_adapter_drift.py`

**Invariants enforced (one per skill):**
- `AD-CO` — `quoin/core/skills/<name>.md` exists (core portable intent doc)
- `AD-AD` — `quoin/adapters/claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` exists (Claude adapter doc)
- `AD-LS` — `quoin/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` exists (legacy stub for install.sh)
- `AD-FN` — adapter frontmatter `name:` field equals the skill name
- `AD-FM` — adapter frontmatter `model:` field matches `claude_model` in the manifest
- `AD-PT` — adapter body contains `quoin/core/skills/<name>.md` as a substring (Phase 21 substring contract; relaxed from exact pointer-line for revise-fast)
- `AD-FB` — legacy stub frontmatter byte-equals adapter frontmatter (after CRLF normalization)
- `AD-SS` — legacy stub is strictly shorter than adapter (sanity check the stub is really a stub)
- `AD-S0P` — for `section_0: true` skills, adapter matches `^## §0 Model dispatch \(FIRST STEP` (line-anchored regex)
- `AD-S0A` — for `section_0: false` skills, adapter does NOT match the same regex
- `AD-PE` — for `spawn_target: true` skills, `quoin/skills/<name>/preamble.md` exists
- `AD-PA` — for `spawn_target: true` skills, `quoin/adapters/claude/skills/<name>/preamble.md` does NOT exist (no confusing duplicate)
- `AD-PX` — for `spawn_target: false` skills, neither preamble path exists
- `AD-IV` — `install.sh` contains `ADAPTER_<NAME_UPPER>_SRC=` preflight assignment
- `AD-IE` — `install.sh` contains an `if` or `elif` branch matching `$skill_name = "<name>"` (capture_insight uses leading `if` as the Phase 6 pilot; all others use `elif`)
- `AD-IO` — `ADAPTER_<NAME_UPPER>_SRC=` preflight appears before the `for skill_dir in "$SCRIPT_DIR/skills"/*/` loop in install.sh

For newer installer-wrapper layouts, AD-IV/AD-IE/AD-IO are satisfied when
`quoin/install.sh` delegates to `python -m quoin install --source-dir ...` and
`src/quoin/installer.py` owns the adapter-precedence rule:
`adapters/claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` is copied when present, otherwise the
legacy `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` stub is used. This preserves Claude install
behavior without keeping duplicate per-skill shell branches in the wrapper.

**Runtime boundary note:** despite living in `core/scripts/` for wrapper-pattern symmetry, the validator is Claude-adapter-specific in scope. It checks `## §0 Model dispatch` headings, `adapters/claude/` paths, and install.sh routing — all Claude-specific concepts. A future Codex adapter drift validator would be a parallel script (`validate_adapter_drift_codex.py`), not a generalization of this one.

**Pilot-test coexistence:** 17 existing `test_*_adapter_pilot.py` files remain as point-in-time regression guards from individual phase migrations. The adapter drift validator is the forward-looking guard for all 21 skills and any future additions. Both coexist; do not delete the pilot tests.
