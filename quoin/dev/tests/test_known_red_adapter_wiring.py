"""IVG-144 T-16: adapter-lint token greps over gate/review SKILL.md.

Cheap literal-token asserts (mirroring test_gate_affected_area_tokens.py /
test_gate_ci_mirror_tokens.py) that verify the known-red manifest wiring
landed in the ACTIVE adapter files and NOT in the deprecated 24/19-line stubs
(R-05, lessons 2026-07-16 #6). Also guards:
  - the MAJ-3 no-self-run invariant at the adapter-text level (no `subprocess`
    self-run string paired with known_red.py; an explicit MAJ-3 marker present);
  - that the known-red wiring does NOT introduce a new drift-guarded named-check
    literal into the gate audit `## Automated checks` enumeration (it rides the
    free `## Warnings (non-blocking)` section instead).
