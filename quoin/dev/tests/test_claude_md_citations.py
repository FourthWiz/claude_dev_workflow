"""IVG-164 stage 1 T-09: fail-closed CLAUDE.md-citation disposition sweep (architecture D-04b).

Enumerates every live `CLAUDE.md`-mentioning line across the three in-scope
deployed corpora (adapter `SKILL.md` files, `quoin/memory/*.md`,
`quoin/scripts/*.py`) and checks it against a committed disposition fixture,
fail-closed in BOTH directions:

  - a live mention line with no matching fixture record FAILS (a new,
    unclassified CLAUDE.md citation cannot ship silently);
  - a fixture record with no matching live mention line FAILS (the fixture
    cannot silently accumulate stale entries after an edit).

Fixture keys are `{file, sha256(normalized_line_text)}` (plan D-04): line
numbers rot on the first unrelated edit, content hashes survive relocation
and still fail loudly on a genuine text change.
