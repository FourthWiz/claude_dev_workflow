"""Tests for IVG-137 T-05: eod-refresh-routine.md memory file and installer wiring.

Mirrors test_discovery_refresh_routine.py's AST-based TIER1_MEMORY_FILES
registration check for discovery-refresh-routine.md — TIER1_MEMORY_FILES is an
explicit allow-list consumed by BOTH deploy_memory() and compute_drift() in
src/quoin/installer.py, and a new memory/ file omitted from the tuple silently
never deploys. Do not rely on tier1-files.md (a reference doc, not the installer
manifest) as a substitute for this registration check.
