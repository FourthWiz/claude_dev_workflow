"""Structural-canary coverage test for `[autonomous]` mode propagation (IVG-153, T-19).

This is the PRIMARY load-bearing test for the autonomous-run-mode feature (Stage 1).
It replaces any hardcoded roster of "skills that need autonomous coverage" with a
LIVE-DERIVED graph traversal: it parses the actual spawn edges out of every SKILL.md
source at test time, computes the transitive closure reachable from `/run`, and asserts
that closure is exactly matched by the set of skills carrying a genuine `[autonomous]`
parse-and-branch. NO count is ever hardcoded in the assertion logic -- a newly added
spawnable skill (or a missed existing one, as `/end_of_task` was in planning rounds 1-2)
makes this test FAIL until it is covered, by construction.

Two guards:
  (a) test_propagation_set_equals_transitive_spawn_closure -- STRUCTURAL set-equality
      guard over the live-derived spawn graph.
  (b) test_every_askuserquestion_site_in_closure_has_autonomous_resolution -- PER-SITE
      coverage lint: every literal `AskUserQuestion` occurrence in the closure must have
      an autonomous resolution in its enclosing (##-heading-bounded) section.

m-2 LIMITATION (documented per plan acceptance): the per-site lint in (b) keys on the
literal token `AskUserQuestion`. Decision points implemented as PROSE ONLY -- thorough_plan's
same-class escalation (rule 3 / "Same-class detection", source lines ~L303/L320) and its
auto-classification confirm (1c, source line ~L149) -- are NOT `AskUserQuestion` call sites
and are therefore invisible to this lint. Those two prose sites are covered manually by
`test_thorough_plan_autonomous.py` (T-05) and must be kept in sync by hand if their wording
changes. A future prompt mechanism that does not use the literal `AskUserQuestion` token
would likewise escape this lint's per-site guard (though NOT the structural set-equality
guard in (a), which is independent of how a prompt is implemented).

# `/architect`") or narrate a THIRD skill's spawn behavior ("`thorough_plan`
# re-prefixes `[autonomous]` onto its `/plan` spawn") without that being an edge
# owned by the file currently being parsed. Both patterns are excluded below so the
# graph reflects only each skill's OWN outgoing spawns.
