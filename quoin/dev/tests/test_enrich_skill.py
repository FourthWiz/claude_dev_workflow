"""
Behavior test for the /enrich skill (IVG-152).

Asserts the active Claude adapter SKILL.md carries the in-lane guardrails that
keep /enrich a lightweight upstream-of-/specify sharpening pass rather than a
spec/plan writer: it writes enriched-prompt.md, has a quick "already clear"
return path, degrades to a flagged best-effort rewrite when non-interactive,
and explicitly stops without invoking any downstream phase.

Per lesson 2026-04-23: no live LLM calls — deterministic string matching only.
