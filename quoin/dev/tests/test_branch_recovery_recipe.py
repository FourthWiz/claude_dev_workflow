"""IVG-77: Drift/wiring tests for the branch-recovery.md Tier-1 memory file.

Asserts:
  (a) The recipe file exists and contains the canonical git update-ref recipe.
  (b) The recipe file does NOT expose git reset --hard as a standalone runnable
      fenced command (only allows it inside the "Why not" rationale prose).
  (c) Each referencing adapter SKILL.md (implement, gate, review, end_of_task)
      contains the __QUOIN_HOME__/memory/branch-recovery.md path literal.
  (d) branch-recovery.md is in TIER1_MEMORY_FILES (installer.py).
  (e) CLAUDE.md contains the branch-recovery.md reference.
  (f) pyproject.toml contains the exact force-include line (dual-list guard,
      IVG-77 CRIT-1 fix — a missing line ships a short wheel and breaks
      test_wheel_memory_inventory_matches_tier1_set).
