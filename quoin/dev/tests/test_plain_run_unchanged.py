"""Non-regression guard for plain `/run` (no `--autonomous`) — IVG-153, T-20(a).

Two independent claims, both asserted at the SKILL.md-lint level (grep the
source, mirroring the repo's existing SKILL.md-lint test style):

  1. `run/SKILL.md`'s `## Checkpoint interaction protocol` table still pauses
     at every checkpoint for plain (non-autonomous) invocations — the five
     interactive rows (yes/no/show/skip/other) plus the "never proceed
     without explicit confirmation" sentence are byte-unchanged from their
     pre-autonomous wording. The autonomous work (T-03) only ADDED a sixth
     "Autonomous" row; it must not have touched the other five.
  2. A leaf skill invoked WITHOUT the `[autonomous]` sentinel takes the
     unchanged interactive dispatch path: the T-23 generator clause (§0'/§0″)
     and the T-25 hand-synced clause (§0-worktree-fallback) are both
     conditional on the sentinel being PRESENT — so their "Otherwise (no
     `[autonomous]` sentinel — non-autonomous behavior unchanged)" fallback
     still reaches the original `AskUserQuestion` prompts. This test asserts
     that conditional guard is present and that the original interactive
     branches (with their original AskUserQuestion option labels) still
     exist verbatim alongside it.

FAILS-without-the-guard: if a future edit made the autonomous branch
unconditional (always fail-OPEN, sentinel or not), the "Otherwise" fallback
text and/or the original AskUserQuestion option labels would disappear from
the block, and this test would catch it.
