r"""T-08 (IVG-141): budget-roster set-equality census over the four adapter SKILL.md files.

Import-free / bare-checkout runnable — pure text scan of the adapter SKILL.md
files. NEVER `import quoin` (lessons 2026-07-22).

Census derivation (PINNED to the T-02 spike outcome — MINOR closeout)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The T-02 subagent-transcript spike PASSED (`leaf-measure`: every one of the four
skills — including the three leaf skills — resolves its own transcript and calls
`context_budget_guard.py`). So the roster is keyed on the `context_budget_guard.py`
INVOCATION token: `SKILLS_WITH_BUDGET_CHECK` = the set of adapter skill dirs whose
SKILL.md text contains `context_budget_guard.py`. The set MUST equal
`{run, implement, thorough_plan, review}`.

Marker-keyed fallback (documented, NOT active): had the spike FAILED (leaf skills
not self-measuring), this census would instead key on the boundary MARKER token
`site=phase-budget-<skill>` so the four-skill invariant would still hold
regardless of who measures. Because the spike PASSED, the invocation-token
derivation is the active one; the `site=phase-budget-` marker is asserted ABSENT
(the over-budget path is non-blocking — no decision-gate site is introduced).

Structural-invariant discipline mirrors `test_decision_gate_census` / the IVG-128
set-equality lesson: a dropped or silently-added skill fails the suite.
