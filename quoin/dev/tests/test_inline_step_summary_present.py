"""Regression test: inline end-of-step summary requirement (IVG-52).

Checks that:
1. Each of the three adapter SKILL.md files (thorough_plan, implement, review)
   contains the required inline-summary instruction in its output/completion section.
2. The shared CLAUDE.md rule exists under ### Communication.

Sentinel phrases are intentionally stable (not exact paragraphs) so minor wording
edits do not break the test. Both phrases must co-occur in the relevant section.

Pin on:
  - "inline summary"  (the instruction name)
  - "plain" OR "human-readable"  (the English-language requirement)
