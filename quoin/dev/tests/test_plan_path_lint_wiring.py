"""IVG-143 T-08: plan_path_lint.py must be wired into the ACTIVE adapter bodies.

Cheap silent-wrong-file guard (R-05): asserts the literal token `plan_path_lint.py`
appears in the active `adapters/claude/skills/{plan,revise,gate}/SKILL.md` bodies —
NOT the deprecated `quoin/skills/*` stubs, which have zero runtime effect. Mirrors
the general "wiring lands in the correct file" discipline used by other IVG-143
sibling integration tests in this repo.
