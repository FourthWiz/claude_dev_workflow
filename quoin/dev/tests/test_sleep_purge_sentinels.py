test_sleep_purge_sentinels.py — regression tests for /sleep --purge --sentinels.

Two-layer test (per plan T-05c / D-04 / MAJ-1):

Layer 1 — SKILL.md contract (scope-bounded grep):
  Open quoin/skills/sleep/SKILL.md. Assert:
    (a) The literal string '--sentinels' appears inside the '## --purge' H2 section.
    (b) All 8 sentinel-family literals appear inside the '## --purge' H2 section:
        pending-restore-*.txt, pending-prompt-*.txt, compact-happened-*.txt,
        mid-agent-handoff-*.txt, pending-resume-ref-*.txt, checkpoint-defer-*.txt,
        postcompact-reset-*.txt, checkpoint-pending-compact-*.txt
  Scope-bounded: grep is limited to the ## --purge section body, not the whole file,
  so a future refactor that splits the section is detected.

Layer 2 — negative safety test (per MAJ-1):
  Verify that --purge --sentinels never enumerates files outside the 8 hardcoded
  families. Use a SKILL.md grep: assert the family list is explicitly enumerated
  (no catch-all globs like '*.txt' or 'pending-*.txt' alone as the iteration target).
  Also assert that 'lessons-learned.md' and 'forgotten/' do NOT appear in the
  ## --purge section's sentinel family list (write-target restriction preserved for
  the delete path as well).

Both layers must pass. Exit 0 on success, non-zero on failure.
