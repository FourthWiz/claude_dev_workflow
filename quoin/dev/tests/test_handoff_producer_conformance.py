"""
Black-box pytest tests for the run skill's handoff-envelope producer
prose.

The validator must be driven from REAL emitted payload values
rather than synthetic hand-constructed pairs. The producer here is
instruction text in adapter skill files, not executable code, so "real
emitted values" means the literal fenced blocks those files instruct the
orchestrator to emit. This file extracts those blocks and runs them
through the same core validator subprocess idiom test_handoff_validate.py
uses — no import of validator internals.

Mirrors test_handoff_validate.py's two-part pass condition throughout:
rc == 0 AND the filtered (blank-line-dropped) stderr line list is empty.
Exit 0 alone admits every advisory-severity rule, which is exactly where
version and key drift surface.
