IVG-165 T-02 (Commit N1) — §0 region end-marker placement invariant.

Verifies `<!-- §0-end -->` (SECTION0_END_MARKER, D-01) is present exactly once
in every §0-carrying SKILL.md, and sits at the pinned byte-offset relative to
the region per proc:marker-place / D-01b:
  - on its own line
  - exactly one `\\n` after the final line of the §0 variant closer (or, for
    `pr`/`workspace`, the `§0b: intentionally omitted` comment line)
  - followed by the SAME single trailing blank line that existed before the
    marker was added, then whatever follows the region (the next `## `
    heading for 19 files; `### Step 1a` for `start_of_day`, which is NOT a
    `## ` boundary — the confirmed sole boundary anomaly this marker fixes
    by construction)

This is a plain-structural test (deterministic pathlib + regex only, no LLM
calls) mirroring the discipline of test_quoin_stage1_worktree_fallback.py.
