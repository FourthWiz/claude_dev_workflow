"""IVG-164 stage 1 T-08: slim content-assertion tests (architecture R-02 primary defense).

A ceiling test (test_claude_md_slim_ceiling.py) passes MORE easily as
content is dropped, so it defends nothing against an essential rule being
silently omitted from CLAUDE.slim.md. This file is the PRIMARY mechanical
defense against that failure mode: eight verbatim assertions pinning the
specific rules a main-session slim variant cannot safely lose, plus the
architecture-AC-3 reachability/ownership groups that close AC-3 limbs 2 and
4 (gates render and block; cost-ledger + session-state writes occur)
mechanically, independent of the T-11 behavioral pilot.

Independence discipline: the eight verbatim anchors below are hardcoded
literal strings transcribed directly from the live quoin/CLAUDE.md source
(not derived via build_claude_slim.CLASSIFICATION or its parser), so a bug
in the generator's own section-extraction logic, or a future accidental
reclassification of one of these headings from keep to drop, is caught here
independently of build_claude_slim.py and of test_build_claude_slim.py.
