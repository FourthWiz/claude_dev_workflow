"""Guard tests for the clean-authored-content rule.

Covers: the rule's canary sentence appears in exactly one file (its own home);
every pointer site is present with the right per-file count; the PR and
implement templates omit planning-artifact filenames within a precisely
block-scoped range; the /pr gathering step collects full diff content, not
stat-only; and no adapter file drifts into restating the rule's prohibition
paragraph verbatim instead of pointing at it.
