"""Text-structural guard over `/run`'s conditioned self-checkpoint bullet — IVG-258 S-6, T-06.

`## Hook cooperation (autonomous)` in `run/SKILL.md` conditions its
self-checkpoint bullet on `run_state_probe` (`hooks/_lib.sh`) rather than
firing unconditionally at `COMPACT_FIRST_BPS`. This is a text-structural
check over the slice — it can prove the prose states the right contract, not
that the sourced call behaves that way at runtime (the executable
counterpart is `test_stage6_checkpoint_probe_wiring_canary.sh` Case B2).
