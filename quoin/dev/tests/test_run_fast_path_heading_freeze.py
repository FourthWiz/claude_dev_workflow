"""Guard tests for IVG-246 T-04: freeze the heading structure of the
Setup..Phase 1.6 region of `run/SKILL.md` against accidental heading-literal
leakage, and pin the `## Checkpoint interaction protocol` table's row count.

Two independent claims:

1. **Freeze-guard (CRIT-2).** The prefix of `run/SKILL.md` up to (but not
   including) `## Phase 2 — Architect` — i.e. Session bootstrap through the
   Phase 1.6 fast-path-triage placeholder — must not accidentally gain a
   second occurrence of any heading literal that belongs to a LATER section
   (Phase 2 onward), beyond the two known, already-inline baseline mentions
   (`` `## Resume` `` and `` `## Checkpoint interaction protocol` ``, each
   referenced exactly once in backticked prose). This is what makes the
   round-3 CRIT-2 fix (P-03b: new Phase 1.6 prose must not restate a later
   heading) mechanically checkable rather than only prose-documented.
2. **Row-count baseline (CRIT-1).** `## Checkpoint interaction protocol`'s
   table has exactly 6 filtered data rows (mirroring
   `test_plain_run_unchanged.py::test_checkpoint_protocol_row_count_unchanged`'s
   own predicate, copied verbatim) and exactly 8 raw pipe-leading lines. Any
   future prose inserted near the Phase 1.6 insertion point that accidentally
   drifts this table's row count will trip this guard.

The freeze-list is derived at RUNTIME from the live headings found in the
file (plus the `_PHASE_HEADINGS` prefix literals imported from
`test_run_resume_idempotent.py`) — no fixed 11- or 16-element literal list
is hardcoded here, so a future heading is covered automatically.
