"""test_context_bundle_exclusions.py — IVG-164 Stage 2 T-08 (updated per review round 1).

Drift tests that enforce the fresh-context invariant:
  (a) critic/revise/revise-fast spawn-prompt construction blocks contain no
      ``[quoin-bundle]`` token and no ``## For human`` forwarding instruction.
  (b) BOTH invariant sentences in thorough_plan/SKILL.md remain present verbatim.
  (c) ``context_bundle.py`` emits ONLY path lines and ``## For human``-sourced
      lines; emits an explicit path-only entry for existing members lacking the
      block; OMITS members whose file does not exist; suppresses summaries
      carrying sentinel tokens; keeps spec.md path-only even when a block is
      present (non-vacuous Class-A guard).

Fixture-driven: every (c) case uses tmp_path fixtures — hermetic on a fresh
clone/CI (review round-1 minor: the old real-data test reached outside the git
repo and degraded to shape-only).
